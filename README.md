# Todo app

This is an sample application where I will experiment with functional programming tools and techniques

- Fullstack typesafe with TypeScript
- Typed functional programming with fp-ts
- Runtime type checking with io-ts
- Property based testing with fast-check
- Manage client state with Redux and effects with Redux-loop
- Functional optics with monocle-ts
- dynamoDB as a database
- Backend with Node.js and Express
- Deploy client side app to to AWS S3 as a static website
- Deploy server side app to the AWS serverless
